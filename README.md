# Advent of Code 2022 - C++

## Setup
1. generate or updates file and folder structure
(creates folder 01-25 and copies the template-structure while replacing '<#>' with the corresponding number)
```
python setup.py
```
2. generate cpp-project-files with premake
```
premake5 vs2022
```

I'm only using vs2022 so i can't guarantee anything

## Running
Configurations: `<PartNumber> <real/example data> <(un)optimized>`

## Coding
Write your code in the run-method of the Part.\
Set the result attribute.\
If the result is not an int change the type of the attribute and (if you need to) the printMethod.
